=========================

# BUILD

npm install
bower install
mvn clean package

# RUN

You can launch the Java server within your IDE, by running the Application class at the root of your application's Java package.

As it is a simple "Main" class, it is the easiest and quickest way to run and debug the application.

If you prefer to use Maven, you can also run your application by typing:

mvn spring-boot:run

The application will be available on http://localhost:8080
